##  Project Experience

###  Financial P2P Transfer System
**Personal Project | 6 Months** [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-181717?style=flat&logo=github)](https://github.com/dbwndnjs32212804/personal-finance-dashboard)

**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA, @Transactional

**Project Overview:** A P2P transfer system developed with the goal of ensuring the stability and data consistency of a financial IT system.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Transaction Management:** Ensured atomicity of the transfer process (withdrawal, deposit, logging) by applying `@Transactional`.
- **Security Issue Resolution:** Diagnosed a 403 Forbidden error by analyzing logs, understanding the difference between 'Authentication' and 'Authorization', and re-establishing security rules suitable for the API environment.
- **Dependency Debugging:** Identified and resolved an issue where the `@NotBlank` annotation failed to work, tracing the cause to a missing dependency in `pom.xml`.
